			<h1>Decred Adds First Intelligent Proposal System to Advance Blockchain Governance</h1>

<p>System Powered by Politeia, a Standalone Tool for Storing Off-Chain Data That Is Both Versioned and Timestamped for Broader Use in Record Storage, Identity Systems, Supply Chains</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Chicago, IL October 26, 2017</em> — Decred, an autonomous digital currency, has launched the first intelligent blockchain proposal system. Powered by Politeia, a standalone tool for off-chain data storage, the system sets a new standard for blockchain governance, allowing anyone in the community to submit a formal proposal that will be timestamped and versioned in an off-chain repository. The launch comes on the heels of Decred&rsquo;s announcement of atomic swaps, a methodology to allow for ad hoc transactions outside the centralized exchanges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Decred has been setting a new standard as one of the most progressive blockchain projects,&rdquo; said noted Bitcoin developer, Jimmy Song. &ldquo;Their proposal system arrives at a time when the industry could benefit from the openness and formalization that Decred is promoting. I look forward to the exciting projects that will come from this system. I am also eager to see how competing blockchains will rise to the occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are more committed than ever to a sustainable and fair system of governance,&rdquo; said Jake Yocom-Piatt, Decred Project Lead. &ldquo;For Decred, Politeia will provide an off-chain public record of proposals, comments on proposals, and stakeholder votes. Although Decred will be using Politeia in a public capacity, it can provide similar utility as a private unalterable store of data. Public and private use-cases include document and record storage, reputation and identity systems, and supply chains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Users should note that while Politeia can be used without holding any Decred, it does depend on using a dcrtime server for creating timestamps. A more detailed technical brief has been posted on the Decred Blog.
